Data Processing Advanced: a course on scientific computing with Numpy/Scipy

Researchers in many scientific and engineering fiels need to access,
manipulate and analyze large amounts of data such as audio and video,
images, text or physiological measurments. Data Science and Machine
Learning are especially data-intensive fields. In this course you will
learn how to leverage the Python tools for scientific computing to
handle data in an efficient and effective manner. You will learn how
to use  numpy and scipy to load, transform and analyze data from a
variety of domains. The topics covered will include:

- [Data types](1_datatypes.ipynb)
- [Arrays (a)](2a_arrays.ipynb)
- [Arrays (b)](2b_arrays.ipynb)
- [Vectorized operations](3_vectorize.ipynb)
- [Linear algebra operations](4_linalg.ipynb)
- [Sparse arrays](5_sparse.ipynb)
- [Distance metrics](6_distance.ipynb)
